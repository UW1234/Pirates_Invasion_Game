How to compile? (Needs Python to Play)

Save the code in a zip file.
Extract the zip file and remember which folder it is in.
Using python create a virstual environment for an http server with any port(prefereblay 8000).
command in CMD(Windows OS): python -m http.server 8000
command in Terminal(Linux or Mac OS): python3 -m http.server 8000
Now that we have a server to run it in go to web browser and type in "http://localhost:8000". This will give you all directories in your file system.
Navigate to the direcctory in which you extracted your zip file and click on that.
Enjoy the Game!
Once finished, use the command, CTRL+C in terminal to exist out of http server and close browser.
Thank You for Playing!
