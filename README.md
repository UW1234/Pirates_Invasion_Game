Pirates Invasion is a physics-based shooting game where you control a cannon to protect your tower from waves of enemy boats. Using precise aim and timing, you must fire cannonballs to sink the approaching boats before they reach your tower. The game consists of six progressively challenging levels, with boats increasing in speed and spawning more frequently as you advance. Destroying 24 boats secures victory, while allowing a boat to collide with your tower results in game over. You can adjust the cannonâ€™s angle using the A and D keys, fire with the spacebar (subject to a cooldown), and restart by clicking after a game over or victory. Strategic shooting and quick reflexes are key to defending your tower and conquering the enemy fleet!
